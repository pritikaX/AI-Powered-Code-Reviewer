❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will lead to errors or unexpected behavior as the
function relies on variables from the outer scope.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and not reusable in different scenarios where you
might want to sum different numbers.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function self-contained and reusable.
* ✔ No reliance on external variables, improving predictability and reducing the risk of side effects.

Additional Notes:

* **Best Practice:** Always explicitly define the parameters a function accepts. This makes the function's purpose clear
and prevents it from accidentally relying on variables from the outer scope (which can lead to bugs).
* **Consider Error Handling:** For production code, you might want to add error handling to check if `a` and `b` are
actually numbers before performing the addition. For example:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers.";
}
return a + b;
}
```

* **Naming Conventions:** While `sum` is a descriptive name for this function, make sure all your functions and
variables have meaningful names that accurately reflect their purpose.
* **Arrow Function (Modern JavaScript):** You could also write this function more concisely using an arrow function:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```
This is a common and readable way to define simple functions in modern JavaScript.
